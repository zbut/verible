# Generate a directory with html coverage. This prepares it to be uploaded
# to a location to serve or to inspect locally.
#
# NOTE: The CI uses codecov, but this script is useful locally.
#   In the actions, we upload the coverage to codecov.io currently, so
#   this HTML generation script is not used in the CI, but is still
#   useful for local coverage checking before sending a pull request.
#   In case we stop using codecov, this is the starting point to generate
#   and upload coverage.
#
# This requires the `lcov` package to be installed.
#
# Precondition, having run bazel coverage with coverage data collection, e.g.
#   MODE=coverage .github/bin/build-and-test.sh
